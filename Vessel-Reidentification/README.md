## Model Architecture

In vessel re-identification, our target is to extract the identity of a given query image using a set of gallery images (the database). Here, the main challenges are the lack of available data in the thermal domain for marine vessels and the change of features for each vessel with a different camera viewpoint. To tackle these issues, we used a model robust to the viewpoint, which can generalize well with a small amount of data. As the first step, we mask out the foreground (the vessel) from a given frame. Since thermal images do not contain color features and the intensity distribution of the foreground and the background are similar, conventional algorithms such as GrabCut do not perform well in this task. As a solution, we used an encoder-decoder architecture with residual connections to build the foreground mask of a given frame.

## Visualization Example
We visualize some examples of vessel images and their
- foreground masks generated by an encoder-decoder model,
- foreground masks generated by deep learning network,
- front, rear and side attention masks.
